# r-basics-vectors-matrices

A compact R fundamentals project showcasing vector creation, indexing, summaries (type/min/max/length),
sorting with missing values, and essential matrix operations (addition, multiplication, transpose, inverse).

## What’s Included
- Vector construction: `c()`, `seq()`, `rep()`
- Basic summaries: `length()`, `typeof()`, `min()`, `max()`, `sum()`
- Sorting with `NA` handling
- Indexing & slicing
- Logical counting (e.g., how many values satisfy a condition)
- Matrix creation and operations: `rbind`, `cbind`, `t`, `%*%`, element-wise ops, `solve()`

## How to Run
```bash
Rscript Livecoding1.R
```
